# README: A3C for Kung Fu

## Project Overview

This project implements the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm applied to the classic "Kung Fu" game environment. A3C is a state-of-the-art algorithm in deep reinforcement learning, known for its efficiency and ability to train agents using multiple threads to update a shared model asynchronously. This approach enables faster convergence and better performance in complex environments.

## Features

- **Efficient Learning:** Implements the A3C algorithm for training agents asynchronously.
- **Customizable Environment:** Adaptable to the "Kung Fu" game environment for reinforcement learning tasks.
- **Scalability:** Capable of training with multiple workers to optimize performance.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools to visualize the learning process and performance metrics.
- **Compatibility:** Designed for TensorFlow/PyTorch frameworks for easy integration and modification.

## A3C Algorithm Explained

The Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm combines two key components:

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture:**

   - The actor selects actions based on a policy.
   - The critic evaluates the selected actions using a value function.

2. **Asynchronous Training:**

   - Multiple threads independently interact with the environment.
   - Updates from all threads are aggregated asynchronously into a shared global model.

### Key Benefits of A3C:

- **Improved Efficiency:** Asynchronous updates reduce training time.
- **Stability:** Reduces the risk of overfitting and stabilizes training.
- **Generalization:** Works well across various environments.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ravij-p/KungFuA3C
   ```
2. Install dependencies manually (if applicable), as this project is based on the single provided file and does not include a `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the training script

## Usage

1. **Modify Parameters:** Customize hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of workers, and training episodes in the configuration file.
2. **Start Training:** Execute the training script to begin training the A3C agent.
3. **Monitor Progress:** Use built-in tools or TensorBoard to visualize metrics like rewards and loss.
4. **Test the Agent:** Run the evaluation script to test the trained agent in the "Kung Fu" environment.
